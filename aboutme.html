                    <p class="aboutMefont">
                        Hi, my name is Ricardo. I'm currently a web development student for the University of Central
                        Florida. After
                        more than 17 years in the medical field I decided that it was time this dog learn some new and
                        hip
                        tricks.
                        I’ve always had a healthy amount of curiosity as to how computers and their interconnectivity
                        work.
                        The
                        advent of mobile applications did nothing to quench that curiosity, instead adding gasoline to
                        this
                        already
                        sizable fire. For many years I proceeded to deliver patient care as a Registered Nurse while
                        knowing
                        I
                        wanted, even needed, a change. However I let an atmosphere of complacency fester, keeping me
                        from
                        pursuing
                        my dream. Thankfully all the hype is true, the brain is indeed a malleable thing, and so is ones
                        pursuit of
                        education! UCF’s web developer bootcamp presented the opportunity to learn the invaluable skills
                        to
                        get me
                        started on the career path of my dreams.
                        <br>







                        Born in Cuba, I came to the states when I was three years old. Since then I have known nothing
                        but
                        Florida
                        as home. Although not without a healthy dose of travel, and a couple brief stints In TN and NC.
                        In
                        Tennessee
                        I stretched my wings as a student for a semester in Collegedale (a real town and not something
                        out
                        of a
                        fairytale I promise). Unfortunately tuition quickly grounded my wings and I returned to Florida
                        to
                        continue
                        my schooling in nursing. North Carolina was enjoyed via a travel assignment. After which I did
                        what
                        many
                        South Floridians do when they decide it’s time to move and try something different. I moved 4
                        hours
                        north to
                        Central Florida. I met my wife and married here, it’s now indeed a place I’m proud to call home.
                        Although
                        San Francisco and its perpetual 75 degrees yearly temperature does provide a dose of envy.

                        As you would have it, life does seem to have its flow in reason. Its yin and yang, or purpose
                        and
                        meaning in
                        events if you will. With the experience I’ve obtained in the last 17 years, I have developed
                        into
                        someone
                        that now embraces challenges. The mix of my curiosity in computing and a growing desire to
                        overcome
                        the
                        challenges coding presents; is something that I know comes in part from those previous life
                        experiences at
                        work. I desire to succeed, to be challenged, more than ever in life, and I can hardly wait for
                        tech
                        to take
                        me there.</p>
